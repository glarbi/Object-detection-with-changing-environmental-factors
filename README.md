# Object-detection-with-changing-environmental-factors
In this work we treat the problem of object detection on changing environmental factors for
driving assistance system. First, we choose the best of algorithms of real-time object detection
methods. Next, we applied an enhancement method that dehumidifies fog and dust to improve
the performance of the chosen method.

Keywords:
Machine learning, driving assistance system, object detection, YOLO-v4.
